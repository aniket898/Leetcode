 a very good bottom-up approach with O(n) time. This solution, though very tricky, is the most standard and common interview question that can be asked about Binary Tree.

We traverse from the bottom, and once we reach a node which matches one of the two nodes, we pass it up to its parent. The parent would then test its left and right subtree if each contain one of the two nodes. If yes, then the parent must be the LCA and we pass its parent up to the root. If not, we pass the lower node which contains either one of the two nodes (if the left or right subtree contains either p or q), or NULL (if both the left and right subtree does not contain either p or q) up.

public static TreeNode commonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
    if (root == null) {
        return null;
    } else if (root == p) {
        return p;
    } else if (root == q) {
        return q;
    }
    if (commonAncestor(root.left, p, q) == null) {
        return commonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
    } else if (commonAncestor(root.right, p, q) == null) {
        return commonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
    } else {
        return root;
    }
}
